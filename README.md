# ArceusRNGTool6.0

## Credits:
  A huge Thank you for all the hours upon hours of hardwork that Lincoln-LM, Capitalism(Cappi), Kurt and Many others who are constantly researching these games and
  developing tools for developers to develop tools for the users. This code is heavily based upon the previous mentioned users contributions to the community. I simply
  took their code, reworked it very very minorly and put it into a GUI. This is essentially just a collection of the current RNG scripts for Pokemon Legends Arceus. 
  ## More Credits:
  Kurt - For creating PKHeX, the Permutation script and many other projects<br>
  Lincoln-LM For creating the original RNG scripts<br>
  Capitalism - For creating the Bonus round pathing script and general support understanding this stuff<br>
  Olizor - For his work on Sysbot.base and all the others who have helped develop it.<br>
  Any one else who has contributed in anyway to the RNG community.<br>
  
  # Usage:
## Standard Spawns:
   1. Set your map that you are currently located in, these scans have to be done from the map.
   2. Select your group id, and current weather/time that you have in your game.
   Check Near:
   1. Set your max advances 5-10 is usually good, any more can take a long time to advance.
   2. Click Check near and it will let you know if there are any shinies within the max advances you set at every single spawner
   at the map, this can take a few seconds.
   Calculate:
   1. Set all of the setings, including the species you are looking for and your shiny rolls
   2. Press Calculate and it will tell you how many advances required for a Shiny of the pokemon you are looking for.
   Inject:
   1. Set your group id and seed to inject which will be automatically filled after using calculate
   2. press inject, catch your shiny. 
## Outbreaks:
  Currently this can only be done while you are in the map. I do plan to adjust this is the near future.
  1. Go to the map of choice.
  2. Select the map you are in
  3. Press Read and it will read the current outbreak and all of the spawns, it will also fill in the group seed box, and the spawn count box.
  4. Set Max advances and hit calculate and it will tell you how many advances to find a shiny, as well as the seed for that shiny to appear in the initial spawns.
      - Click the Alpha Search if you would like an Alpha-Shiny to appear
  5. Either figure out a way to advance or click inject to write the seed it calculated.
