# ArceusRNGTool6.0

## Credits:
  A huge Thank you for all the hours upon hours of hardwork that Lincoln-LM, Capitalism(Cappy), Kurt and Many others who are constantly researching these games and
  developing tools for developers to develop tools for the users. This code is heavily based upon the previous mentioned users contributions to the community. I simply
  took their code, reworked it very very minorly and put it into a GUI. This is essentially just a collection of the current RNG scripts for Pokemon Legends Arceus. 
  ## More Credits:
